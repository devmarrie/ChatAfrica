Here, I'm setting up Flask and Jinja to be used as the backend and frontend framework for the ChatAfrica web application.
The procedures are as follows:
** Installation of flask and Jinja
** Creation of a basic Flask app structure and defining the routes
** Integrating Jinja into the Flask app for template rendering
