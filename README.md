# Chat Africa
This repository contains our end of foundations project called **ChatAfrica** which is a web-based chatbot application that allows one to know more about the African culture and its diversity. The application uses GPT-3 to generate responses and renders it to the user in text format. Other resources used to train the data are found in the folder named [content](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/content).

Additional **applications** and **dependencies** used are listed in the [requirement.txt](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/blob/master/requirements.txt) file. The [backend](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend) folder houses all the tasks carried out at the backend level.

## Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com//devmarrie/ChatAfrica.git"`
* Access ChatAfrica directory: `cd ChatAfrica`

# File Description 
## [Backend](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend)
It contains the endpoints connecting various parts of the application including the database, frontend and the GPT-3 api.
These endpoints are stored in the following files or folders:

#### [`api`](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/api)
This folder contains the following files:

- [**auth.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/api/auth.py) - It contains the google authentication implementation and the login routes used by the user to login or signup and access various parts of the application.
Once the user logs in he/she is directed to the chat page.

- [**views.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/api/views.py) - contains an implementation of the chats, user and questions  routes. 

#### [`chat_engine`](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/chat_engine)
This folder contains the code implementation of how we trained the GPT-3 api with content exclusive to Africa and its connection with our backend.

- [**content**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/chat_engine/content) - this folder contains all the data we used to train our model.
- [**ask_ChatAfrica.py** ](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/chat_engine/ask_ChatAfrica.py)- generates the responses to user's questions.
- [**construct_index.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/chat_engine/construct_index.py) - constructs an index of text documents using GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models.
- [**index.json**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/chat_engine/indx.json) - contains the data used to train gpt-3 continuously and test if it is working perfectly.

#### [`models`](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models) 
It contains classes used for creating orms used to define the database tables of this project:
- [**base_model.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/base_model.py) - defines an abstract table which is inherited by all the other tables
- [**chat.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/chat.py) - defines the chat table
- [**db_storage.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/db_storage.py) - testing the database and bringing the tables to life.
- [**question.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/question.py) - used to create the question table in the database.
- [**response.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/response.py) - used to create the response table.
- [**user.py**](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/backend/models/user.py) - used to create the user table.
